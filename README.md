### Ohm's_Law

BC. 600, From the story that **Thales** found electricity by rubbing cloth on `elektron`, a kind of gem (now we called Amber), the electricity comes from the Greek word.

In 1827 Germany, about 2400 years later, **Georg Ohm** found the law that can express the relations of them mathematically,  `Current`(Intensity of electric current), `Voltage`(V), and `Resistance`(R).
